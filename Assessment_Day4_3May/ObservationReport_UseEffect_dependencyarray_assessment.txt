Following useEffects configurations were used

1. useEffect with an empty dependency array 
-This will be called only during the first load and not on every render

2. useEffect with no dependency array
-Since there is no dependency so this will be called on load as well as during every render

3. useEffect with `name` as the dependency.
-Since the dependency is on name array, hence this will be called every time name is re-redered.
-Also since we are initializing name as empty during load which also renders it, hence it will be called during load as well.

4. useEffect with `counter` as the dependency.
-Since the dependency is on counter array, hence this will be called every time counter is re-redered.
-Also since we are initializing counter as 0 during load which also renders it, hence it will be called during load as well.

5. useEffect with both `name` and `counter` as dependencies.
-Since the dependency is on counter as well as name array, hence this will be called every time counter or name is re-redered.
-Also since we are initializing counter and name during load which also renders it, hence it will be called during load as well.
